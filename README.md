A terrabody is a computer for a wizard. 

Terrabody is a Body With Organs. 

An Organ has a particular function. It receives input, chews on it, digests, and then spits it out into an output. 

Each organ listens. 
If it receives a request, it chews and digests, then replies. 
Sometimes, it occasionally announces, like burping into the air. 
Sometimes, it requests something from another organ in order to chew better. 

Organs are pretty independent. Anything about an internal state, it burps. If it wants something specific to happen, it requests. 

In broadcast form: an organ its name + announcement + payload


part of the (t e r r a) system.
